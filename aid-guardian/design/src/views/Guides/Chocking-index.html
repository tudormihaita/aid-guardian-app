    <h1>Choking First Aid Instructions</h1>
    <p>If someone is choking, they need immediate help. Here are the steps you should follow:</p>

    <h2>For an Adult or Child over One Year Old:</h2>
    <p>If the person can cough forcefully, encourage them to keep coughing.</p>
    <p>If the person cannot cough, speak, or breathe, use the Heimlich maneuver:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Stand behind the person and wrap your arms around their waist.</li>
        <li>Make a fist with one hand. Place the thumb side of your fist just above the person's navel, below the ribcage.</li>
        <li>Grasp your fist with your other hand and press into the person’s abdomen with a quick, upward thrust.</li>
        <li>Repeat thrusts until the object is expelled or the person becomes unconscious.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>If the Person Becomes Unconscious:</h2>
    <p>Lower them to the ground and start CPR:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Kneel next to the person's shoulders.</li>
        <li>Begin chest compressions by placing the heel of one hand on the center of the chest and your other hand on top. Push hard and fast, compressing at least 2 inches deep at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute.</li>
        <li>After 30 compressions, check the mouth for any visible obstructions. Remove any object you can see and reach.</li>
        <li>Attempt to give two rescue breaths. Tilt the head back, lift the chin, and give a breath to make the chest rise. If the chest doesn’t rise, reposition and try again.</li>
        <li>Continue with cycles of 30 compressions and 2 breaths until help arrives or the person starts to breathe normally.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>For an Infant Under One Year Old:</h2>
    <p>If the infant is coughing or gagging, let them try to clear the object.</p>
    <p>If the infant cannot cough, cry, or breathe, do the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Sit down and hold the infant face down on your forearm, resting on your thigh. Support the infant's head and jaw with your hand.</li>
        <li>Give up to 5 back blows between the infant’s shoulder blades with the heel of your hand.</li>
        <li>If the object is not expelled, turn the infant face up, resting on your thigh, and give up to 5 chest thrusts. Place two fingers in the center of the infant’s chest just below the nipple line, and press down about 1.5 inches.</li>
        <li>Repeat the sequence of 5 back blows and 5 chest thrusts until the object is expelled or the infant becomes unresponsive.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>If the Infant Becomes Unresponsive:</h2>
    <p>Begin infant CPR:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the infant on a flat surface and start chest compressions by using two fingers to press down in the center of the chest just below the nipple line, compressing about 1.5 inches deep.</li>
        <li>Give 30 compressions at a rate of 100-120 per minute, followed by two rescue breaths.</li>
        <li>Continue with cycles of 30 compressions and 2 breaths until help arrives or the infant starts to breathe normally.</li>
    </ol>
