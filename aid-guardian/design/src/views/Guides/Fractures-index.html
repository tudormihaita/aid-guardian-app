    <h1>Fractures First Aid Instructions</h1>
    <p>Fractures, or broken bones, require immediate medical attention. Here are the steps you should follow:</p>

    <h2>Steps to Treat Fractures:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Stop Any Bleeding:</strong> If the person is bleeding, apply pressure with a clean cloth or bandage.</li>
        <li><strong>Immobilize the Injured Area:</strong> Keep the injured area as still as possible. Use a splint or sling to immobilize the limb.</li>
        <li><strong>Apply Cold:</strong> Use an ice pack or cold compress to reduce swelling and pain. Do not apply ice directly to the skin.</li>
        <li><strong>Provide Pain Relief:</strong> Give over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen if the person is in pain.</li>
        <li><strong>Seek Medical Attention:</strong> Call emergency services or take the person to the nearest hospital or urgent care center.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>For Open Fractures:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Do Not Push the Bone Back In:</strong> Do not attempt to push a bone back in if it is protruding through the skin.</li>
        <li><strong>Cover the Wound:</strong> Cover the wound with a sterile bandage or clean cloth to prevent infection.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>For Suspected Neck or Back Injuries:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Do Not Move the Person:</strong> Do not move the person unless absolutely necessary, such as if they are in immediate danger.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep the Person Still:</strong> Encourage the person to remain as still as possible. Use rolled towels or cushions to keep the neck and head stable.</li>
        <li><strong>Call Emergency Services:</strong> Seek immediate medical help.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Special Considerations:</h2>
    <p>Always suspect a fracture if there is severe pain, swelling, bruising, or an inability to move the limb. In the case of a suspected fracture, it is better to be safe and seek medical attention even if you are not sure.</p>
